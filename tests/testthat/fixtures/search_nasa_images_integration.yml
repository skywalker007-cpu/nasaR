        2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter arrived at Mars on Oct. 24, 2001.  Over the past
        two decades, the mission has mapped the composition of the Martian surface,
        providing a window to the past so scientists could piece together how the
        planet evolved. It has also served as a vital asset in relaying communications
        between landers and rovers at the Red Planet and the mission teams back on
        Earth.  Here are some of the highlights of the last 20 years:      Mars Odyssey
        has completed 80,000 orbits.     Mars Odyssey has taken more than 1.2 million
        images.     Mars Odyssey has returned 16 terabits of total science data to
        Earth, including 1 terabit of data relayed from Mars surface missions.     Mars
        Odyssey has provided communications relay for six Mars surface missions: the
        Phoenix and InSight landers, as well as the Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity,
